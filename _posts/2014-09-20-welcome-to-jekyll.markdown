This line contains a php block ({% highlight php nowrap %}<?php phpinfo(); ?>{% endhighlight %}) right in the middle of everything.

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
#
# Several more lines of comments are required.
#
# With them, we can see what happens with the line number styles
# when we go
# from e.g. nine lines to ten lines.
{% endhighlight %}
